The Demon King took over[NL]
my family and killed my...[A][NL]
Eh, that joke is overused anyway.[A][NL]
[OpenLeft][LoadBastion]
Madam Gunborg! Enemies[NL]
are attacking this town![A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
We must ride to help![A][NL]
[OpenLeft]
Yes, exactly![A][NL]
...Wait, ride? But we[NL]
don't have any horses-[A][NL]

[ToggleSmile]We won![A][NL]
[OpenLeft][LoadScully]
This was just the[NL]
first of many battles.[A][NL]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadWilbur]
We must continue our journey to[NL]
defeat the heretical Demon King.[A][NL]
[OpenLeft]
And the evil empire.[A][NL]
And bandits.[A][NL]
And cultists.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
Really, let's just defeat[NL]
whatever villains we come across.[A][NL]

## Ch21_StartingScene
[OpenMidRight][LoadGunborg]
At last, we're here...[N]
the lair of the Demon King.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadXholt]
The Demon King killed my family[N]
and took over my country![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Really? We're doing that cliche now?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm afraid so. To be fair,[N]
the country part is true.[AN]
I used to be sorcerer-king of the desert,
but the Demon King deposed me.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You look like a powerful wizard.[AN]
If you want to help us[N]
fight the Demon King,[AN]
we won't turn down your aid.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you. I am Xholt,[N]
a master of dark magic.[AN]
Let us destroy this fiend together![AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]
[ToggleColorInvert]MWAHAHA![N]
YOU WILL NEVER DEFEAT ME![ToggleColorInvert][A][X]

## Ch21_TimeLoop
[OpenFarLeft][LoadXholt]
[OpenLeft][LoadBastion]
[OpenMidRight][LoadGunborg]
And so falls the demon king.[N]
That was oddly anticlimactic.[AN]
[OpenLeft]
This doesn't... feel right...[N]
It's like the world is... distorting?[AN]
What's happening to me?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I feel it too...[AN]
Xholt, you know more about[N]
magic than anyone alive.[AN]
Did we cause this?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
No... we are in a time loop.[AN]
[OpenLeft]
What?[AN]
!!! I'm being dragged back[N]
in time! AAAUGH![AN]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
Bastion![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
We don't have long![AN]
I'll use this staff to reset[N]
time to the start of the battle.[AN]
You need to [ToggleRed]defeat...[N]
the demon king quickly enough...[ToggleRed][AN]
Within... [CloseEyes][ToggleRed]ten turns...[ToggleRed][AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
This staff...[AN]
Maybe with it, we can[N]
redo the time loop![A][X]

## Ch21x_Beginning
[OpenMidRight][LoadGunborg]
We've done it! We've[NL]
escaped the time loop![AN]
Wait...[AN]
The Demon King's corpse...[NL]
It's... being absorbed by something?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMulch]
[ToggleColorInvert]Hahaha... HAHAHAHHAAAA![ToggleColorInvert][AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Wait... That's the very first enemy[NL]
we defeated! The Hellfire Frog![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleColorInvert]Yes... Yes, it is I![AN]
You thought you killed me,[NL]
but I lived on as a spirit.[AN]
Once you slew the Demon King, I[NL]
returned from death and absorbed his power![AN]
No longer must I hide[NL]
behind being a mere mercenary![AN]
I am Mulch, the Hellfire Frog![AN]
No... THE HELLFIRE GOD!!![ToggleColorInvert][AN]
[OpenRight]
That's enough![AN]
I will defeat you[NL]
and save the world![AN]
Don't worry, Bastion.[NL]
I'll crush these bastards![A][X]


## Ch21x_Ending
[OpenMidRight][LoadGunborg]
At last, I've done it! I've[NL]
defeated the true demon king![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMan4]
I'm proud of you, my daughter.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Dad? Is that you?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Of course it is![AN]
What, did you think your[NL]
father would die so easily?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
[CloseEyes]Well... sorta.[AN]
In all the stories,[NL]
the hero's parents die...[AN]
"The Demon king killed my family[NL]
and took over my country",[AN]
I have to destroy my father's corpse who[NL]
pierces the skies with divine lightning,[AN]
[OpenEyes]that sort of thing.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hogwash! This is real life,[NL]
not some children's tale.[AN]
Come on. Let's go home together.[AN]
I'm sure you have loads of[NL]
stories of your adventures![A][X]
